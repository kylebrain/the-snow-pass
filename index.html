        	<h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Driving through certain parts of Nevada in the winter months can be dangerous and unpredictable. 
			Snowfall, high winds, and icy roads are all potential hazards drivers can face, all of which can disrupt travel plans. 
			Add in official statements and reports such as road closures or chain requirements, and there is a vast amount of information for someone planning a trip through the Sierra Nevadas. 
			The Snow Pass application will address this problem by providing a multi-platform data hub that collects information specifically configured to the user’s driving needs from multiple different sources and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface.  
			Snow Pass will focus on the combination of weather statistics, maps, live-feed road cameras, and Twitter announcements from both the Nevada and California Departments of Transportation (DOT). Based on the team’s own experience as well as the Stakeholder Interviews, these sources provide sufficient knowledge to safely and successfully plan a drive through the mountains or any other potentially dangerous regions during the winter. Weather information is pivotal to drivers, so the application will allow users to take advantage of this functionality in multiple ways; users can choose to view the weather of their current location, input a new location, or plan a trip, in which case Snow Pass will offer weather reports for a selection of points along their path. Additionally, the maps feature will allow users to determine the best route to get to their destination, while providing a time estimate and some traffic information, such as slow driving areas and accidents. Users will also be provided with a selection of live-feed road cameras along their planned route so they can view road conditions with their own eyes in order to verify the safety of the roadways. The last source of information included in Snow Pass will be a feed of recent Tweets from state DOTs, allowing users to stay up to date on any official announcements, such as chain control levels or road closures.

			<p>The intended audience will be people in Nevada who drive during the winter, with a special emphasis on students from UNR. 
			Initially, the scope will be small, focusing on people driving from Reno to the Sacramento area. 
			Then, the team plans to expand to the entire state of Nevada, and possibly to other states as well.</p>
